                <p>Issues related to Security, Education, Health, Environment,
                    Disaster/Crisis Management have at some point primary root:
                    <b> Development. </b> Peace and prosperity are the focal points
                    of the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld"
                    target="blank">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development </a> . Population in
                    the developing world suffer from deprivations of the most
                    basic needs, and connections to insurgencies or internal conflicts are 
                    non-suprising patterns that threaten development and well-being.
                </p>
                <p>I focus on the interdepencies between <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9"
                    target="blank">Goal 9</a> and <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16"
                    target="blank">Goal 16</a> of the SDGs. How attacks
                    on civil society and conflict escalation that affect critical infrastructure such
                    as power grids, roads, or pipelines are holding back development progress. At the
                    same time, governments have to work on different strategies to prevent basic services
                    from failure. To learn from conflicts that often target national infrastructure, 
                    I study the long-lasting Colombian conflict between government, paramilitary groups and left-wing
                    guerrillas. Colombia has suffered decades of this kind of internal conflict that has been
                    labeled as domestic terrorism.

                    <h3>My research and projects</h3>
                     <div style="line-height: 1.5">
                    <p> I use generalized regression models to identify factors that may explain the subversive activity
                    of the different beligerent groups. Modeling human rights violations, threats, pipeline and 
                    tower attacks require a non-normal setup. Socio-economic factors at the municipal and 
                    department level are captured in multilevel models considering time-variant and time-invariant 
                    control variables. 
                    The main objectives of this research are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand the motivations of subversive groups at the local level, compared to a broad and
                        general motivation at a national level </li>
                        <li>Analyze the <i>modus operandi</i> of illegal groups that attack critical infrastructure to
                        inform potential risks to the government and service providers. </li>
                        <li>Find connections with developmental issues that general population suffer to understand the 
                        processes of peace agreements and reconciliations after decades of opression and insecurity.
