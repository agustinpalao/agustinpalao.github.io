            <p> Access to finance is the delivery of formal financial services such as credit, checking accounts,
                insurance, and diverse risk management services. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assess the inclusiveness of the banking system in the U.S. 
                Either at the household or firm level, financial services should be safe, secure and affordable. </p>
            <p> However, it is well-known the existence of
                financial accessibility constraints in certain business sectors and population 
                due to low profitablity, information asymmetries and high-risk perception that create poor 
                incentives to invest by private banks and financial intermediaries. <u>In the U.S., 32% of Households
                are unbanked or underbanked, and worldwide the number of commercial bank branches can be less than 
                5 in developing countries.</u>

                    <p> Several responses have been developed to reduce the lack of financial accessibility
                        such as the popular <u> Microlending </u> we have seen growing in since the 1970s when Garmeen
                        Bank started operations at a massive scale. Despite well-documented successful cases,
                        some concerns arose due to 
                        continous controversies about the For-Profit motivations of the lenders making money
                        off the poor as oposed to poverty-alleviation motivations. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Alternatively, governments and NGOs have been implementing for several decades
                        another device called <b> Credit Guarantee Schemes (CGS)</b> to support entities that
                        do not fulfill the eligibility conditions of the private financial sector to gain
                        access to regular financial services. To learn more about CGS you can consult this

                    <h3>My research and projects</h3>
                    <div style="line-height: 1.5">
                    <p> I have applied Impact Evaluation techniques to evaluate a Federal Credit Guarantee Scheme in Mexico.
                    This CGS is aimed at Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) producing in any place in the country.
                    My research questions were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does CGS contribute to existent policies by increasing financial access for the self-sustaining 
                            peasant economy?</li>
                        <li>Is finanial access enough to promote enterprise transition and rural economic growth?</li>
                        <li>Does CGS in fact identify and support the most needful rural business?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Regression discontinuity, stochastic frontier analysis and exploratory spatial
                        data analysis allowed me to answer these questions finding interesting results that 
                        sometimes differed from the original objective of the policy. If you are interested in
